## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

As i did this as mobile first I learned how to get everything fixed in the midlle of the screen after looking with normal screen (over 800px)
The last section (nutritions) I did with Display Grid as it seemed to work the best for this one.
